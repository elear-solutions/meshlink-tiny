# License obligations

The source code of the MeshLink library itself is licensed under the GNU
General Public License version 2 or later (see the file COPYING for the
complete license). However, the MeshLink library depends on other libraries as
well, which each have their own license. This document summarizes your
obligations when you are releasing binaries that link with the MeshLink library
and any dependent libraries, for both open source and closed source software.

Please note that this document is not to be interpreted as a license itself.

## List of libraries that MeshLink depends on

* Ed25519 (zlib license)
* Chacha20-Poly1305 (public domain)

## Obligations for closed source software

With closed source software, we mean any software that is distributed only in
binary form. Note that there is no distinction between software that is sold,
rented out, or is gratis. You are not allowed to distribute closed source
software linked to the MeshLink library unless you have obtained a commercial
license for the MeshLink library. If you do distribute closed source software
linked to MeshLink without a commercial license, you are violating
international copyright law. In this case, please contact the MeshLink
author(s) as soon as possible in order to remedy this situation.

If you do have a commercial license for the MeshLink library, then apart from
the obligations set out in the commercial license, you are also obligated to
follow the rules set out in the licenses of the libraries MeshLink depends on.
In particular, ensure you give credits to the library authors:

* Attribute Orson Peters as the author of the Ed25519 library.
* Attribute Daniel J. Bernstein as the author of the Chacha20-Poly1305 library.
* Attribute Guus Sliepen as the author of the MeshLink library.

## Obligations for open source software

With open source software, we mean any software that is distributed in source
form, or is distributed in binary form with the exact source code used to
compile the binary form made publicly available, or with this source code
made available on request. Note that there is no distinction between software
that is sold, rented out, or is gratis.

If your software itself does not contain any copies or excerpts of the source
code of MeshLink, you are free to distribute that software under any license
you want. However, as soon as you distribute any binaries that are linked with
MeshLink, then the resulting binaries can only be distributed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later. In practice, this is not
a problem since if you make the source code available publicly, you are
fulfilling the obligations of the GPL, unless your software has a software
license that is incompatible with the GPL. Please check the following website
to find out if your open source software is compatible with MeshLink:

https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#SoftwareLicenses

Apart from the obligations for the MeshLink library, set out in the GPL, you
are also obligated to follow the rules set out in the licenses of the libraries
MeshLink depends on.
In particular, ensure you give credits to the library authors:

* Attribute Orson Peters as the author of the Ed25519 library.
* Attribute Daniel J. Bernstein as the author of the Chacha20-Poly1305 library.
* Attribute Guus Sliepen as the author of the MeshLink library.

## Recommended attribution text

Attribution for the libraries your software depends on should be added to any
written, printed or electronic documentation that comes with your software, as
well as displayed in any about dialogs, splash screens, and any other forms of
display that contain credits, license information and/or attribution. The
recommended text to display is:

    This software makes use of the following libraries:

    - MeshLink, copyright © 2014-2018 Guus Sliepen,
      licensed under the GPL version 2 or later¹
    - Chacha20-Poly1305, by Daniel J. Bernstein, public domain
    - Ed25519, copyright © 2015 Orson Peters, licensed under the zlib license

¹) omit the "licensed under" text if you have a commercial license  

The full text of the licenses of all libraries used should be included in the
documentation, and should be included in any forms or displays that contain
license information.
