Features
--------

MeshLink-tiny is a version of the MeshLink library optimized for devices with
very little resources. In particular, it tries to reduce code size and memory
usage, while keeping as much the API and network protocol compatible with the
full MeshLink library as much as possible.

MeshLink is a library that allows applications to connect to other instances of
itself, and exchange messages in a secure way. MeshLink provides end-to-end
encryption and authentication of messages with perfect forward secrecy. The
MeshLink library starts its own thread which handles all network
communications. The application only needs to register callbacks to get
notified of incoming messages and other important events.

Other noteworthy features are:

- IPv6 support
- NAT traversal (requires at least one node that is not behind a NAT)
- Ed25519 keys (TBD)
- ChaCha-Poly1305 encryption and message authentication
